ASEPSiS BlueJ Extension
======
ASEPSiS is a collection of tools that support the processes around programming assignments in the teaching of programming.
While the primary goal is to support these processes, another important aspect is the quality of the software itself.
ASEPSiS is developed with careful consideration of software quality attributes to minimize the risk of *rotting* over time.
Therefore, every piece has been built with **modern processes** and **state-of-the-art tools**, including, but not limited to:

* Behavior-driven development
* Automated acceptance tests
* Automated build management, and
* Clean code principles

At the moment, the only part of the ASEPSiS system is the BlueJ extension, which is why the general information is included here.

## Features
The ASEPSiS BlueJ extension integrates functionality for handing in and receiving feedback on assignments into the core experience
of BlueJ. Notable features are:

* Todo :-)

## The name
ASEPSiS is an acronym (|A|ssimilated A|s|sessment |E|nvironment for |P|rogramming As|si|gnment|s|) and a word in itself.

* Asepsis: *the condition of being aseptic* [[1]](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/asepsis)
* Aseptic: *free or freed from pathogenic microorganisms* [[2]](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aseptic)

The name is a metaphor for the large focus on software quality in the system; to be free from unclean, smelly, decease-inducing software.
